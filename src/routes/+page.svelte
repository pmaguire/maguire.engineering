	<h3>Hey, I'm Patrick.</h3>
	<h2>I solve problems and build things.</h2>
	<p>I'm a full stack Javascript and Python dev with expertise in AWS and GIS.</p>
	<p>
		I've built hospitals, battled disease outbreaks, taught physics, and designed and installed
		solar PV systems.
	</p>
	<p>
		Since moving into tech in 2011, I've architected, written, tested, released, debugged, and
		project managed software, and I've directed the quality assurance and release team for a 100+
		member software organization.
	</p>
	<p>
		Most recently, I was a lead software developer at a renewable energy startup, where I
		architected and built our APIs, AWS infrastructure, and a front end GIS application, among many
		other things.
	</p>
