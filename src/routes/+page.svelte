	<h1>I solve problems and build things.</h1>
	<p>I'm a full stack Javascript and Python dev with AWS and GIS expertise.</p>
	<p>
		I've built hospitals, battled disease outbreaks, taught physics, and designed and installed
		solar PV systems.
	</p>
	<p>
		Since moving into tech in 2011, I've architected, written, tested, released, debugged, and
		project managed software, and I've directed the quality assurance and release team for a 100+
		member software organization.
	</p>
	<p>
		Most recently, I was a lead software developer and team lead at a renewable energy startup,
		where I architected and built out our APIs, AWS infrastructure, and a front end GIS application,
		among many other things.
